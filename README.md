# World_Weather_Analysis
This repository is intended to hold the following.

A Weather_Database folder with the following:
The Weather_Database.ipynb file
The WeatherPy_Database.csv file

A Vacation_Search folder with the following:
The Vacation_Search.ipynb file
The WeatherPy_Database.csv file

NONE of the following files are provided because my ability to perform the exercises in the module required the use of google's API service.

Google's API service requires the use of a credit card to obtain an API key. Due to on-going electronic website fraud I am currently still dealing with, I can not risk further possibility that this API would be used to incur any more undeserved charges.
