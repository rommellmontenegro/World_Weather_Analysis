# World_Weather_Analysis
This repository is intended to hold the following.

A Weather_Database folder with the following:
The Weather_Database.ipynb file
The WeatherPy_Database.csv file

A Vacation_Search folder with the following:
The Vacation_Search.ipynb file
The WeatherPy_Database.csv file

NONE of the following files are provided because my ability to perform the exercises in the module required the use of google's API service.

Google's API service requires the use of a credit card to obtain an API key. Due to on-going electronic website fraud I am currently still dealing with, I can not risk further possibility that this API would be used to incur any more undeserved charges.

Hello Jeffrey,

Should I expect to hear back about how I should proceed before 5PM today?

At this point in time, I would need to proactively request an extension for the homework's deadline for any time that elapses after 2PM PST today until the time when a response is provided on your end. That extension would only apply to a Mon-Sun business hours schedule, 8 AM-5 PM PST. 

So for example, if I hear back from you at 5 PM PST, then the homework deadline extension request would be until 11PM PST Monday. 
If I hear back from you at 12PM PST tomorrow, then that extension would translate to 3 PM PST Monday.

I know you allow students to turn in homework late, but I do sincerely try to meet my deadlines. The structure of this course doesn't permit for someone to fall behind in deliverables since the nature of the course material and the instruction's steps required in the homework do take amount to meet the expectations.

I hope you think this is a fair request.

Thank you,

Rommell
